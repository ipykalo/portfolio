          👋 Hello there! I'm a seasoned software engineer with over 5 years of
          hands-on experience in crafting web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          💻 My expertise lies in web development, where I thrive in the HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript trio. I'm passionate about creating seamless and
          visually appealing user experiences that leave a lasting impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          🅰️ On the front-end, I'm well-versed in the Angular framework,
          employing it to build robust and dynamic user interfaces. I have an
          eye for design and a commitment to delivering responsive and intuitive
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          🚀 Beyond the client-side, I've extended my skills to the server
          realm. I have a solid foundation in server-side development using
          technologies like Node.js and NestJS. Databases like MongoDB are my
          playground, where I ensure data integrity and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          🌐 Whether it's shaping the client's journey with a sleek UI or
          orchestrating server-side functionalities, I bring a holistic approach
          to web development. My goal is to create software that not only meets
          technical requirements but also exceeds user expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          📱 In addition to web applications, I bring valuable experience in
          building mobile applications. I've successfully developed Apps for
          mobile and tablet (Android, IOS, Windows) devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          🌱 Always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies, I stay
          up-to-date with the latest trends in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
          Let's build something extraordinary together! 🚀
